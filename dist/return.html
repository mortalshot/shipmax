											<h1>Return Managment</h1>
											<p></p>
											<p>Amazon is a globally dominant e-commerce site that gives international sellers easy
												access to American shoppers. However, Amazon also has stringent standards for
												customer satisfaction, and that means loose return policies for buyers to a
												U.S.-based address, which can be a challenge for international sellers. American
												customers often get annoyed by international sellers due to their high shipping
												costs, delays in delivery, and lags in the return and exchange of products.</p>

												We assist our clients in preparing prepaid shipping labels for any returns. In order

									<h2>The process</h2>
									<p></p>
									<p>The Amazon FBA service provides an easy and accessible online return process.
										Sellable items are put back in your FBA inventory, whereas those products that are
										damaged are disposed of. These items must be inspected, as often they are still
										viable for sale. This part of the Amazon FBA process can impact your profits by
										disposing of sellable items, but ShipMax can manage this aspect by inspecting items
										and sending you their photos for you to decide whether to resell these products or
										dispose of them. </p>

									<p>Our return management system is automated, so it keeps your customers in the loop in
										terms of their products and any returns they have made. By providing various tools
										on our platform, we make sure you don't incur losses on return products. These tools
										can help you in managing your returns and keeping track of your return inventory.
										This keeps the return management system transparent, which is often not the case
										with the Amazon FBA. ShipMax offers return management through a user-friendly
										interface that allows for easy management and tracking. Business clients using our
										software can easily access the status of their returned products and can view the
										return data and full history of their products through their account dashboard.</p>
